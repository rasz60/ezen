		And now friends, we'd like to introduce you to
		A brand new song
		It's completely different from anything we've ever done
		And this is the title
		Of our brand new Twentieth Century Fox movie
		And it's also my new star seal of victory, escape, release
		And I would like to say right now that, uh
		The people over at Twentieth Century Fox have really been wonderful
		All the great stars and the cast, the director and the producers
		This is our first picture, they really helped us along
		And with the help of the very wonderful Jordanaires
		A song called, "Love Me Tender"
		Love me tender, love me sweet
		Never let me go
		You have made my life complete
		And I love you so
		Love me tender, love me true
		All my dreams fulfilled
		For my darling, I love you
		And I always will
		Love me tender, love me long
		Take me to your heart
		For it's there that I belong
		And we'll never part
		Love me tender, love me true
		All my dreams fulfilled
		For my darling, I love you
		And I always will
		Love me tender, love me dear
		Tell me you are mine
		I'll be yours through all the years
		'Til the end of time
		Love me tender, love me true
		All my dreams fulfilled
		For my darling, I love you
		And I always will
	</pre>
	<h3 id="can">Can't help falling in love</h3>
	<pre>
		Wise men say
		Only fools rush in
		But I can't help falling in love with you
		Shall I stay?
		Would it be a sin
		If I can't help falling in love with you?
		Like a river flows
		Surely to the sea
		Darling, so it goes
		Some things are meant to be
		Take my hand
		Take my whole life too
		For I can't help falling in love with you
		Like a river flows
		Surely to the sea
		Darling, so it goes
		Some things are meant to be
		Take my hand
		Take my whole life too
		For I can't help falling in love with you
		For I can't help falling in love with you
	</pre>
	<h3 id="it">It's now or never</h3>
	<pre>
		When I first saw you with your smile so tender
		My heart was captured, my soul surrendered
		I spent a lifetime waiting for the right time
		Now that you're near, too bad you're queer my dear
		It's now or never, come hold me tight
		Kiss me my darling, be mine tonight
		Tomorrow will be too late
		It's now or never, my love won't wait
		Just like a willow, we would cry an ocean
		If we lost true love and sweet devotion
		Your lips excite me, let your arms invite me
		For who knows when we'll meet again this way
		It's now or never, come hold me tight
		Kiss me my darling, be mine tonight
		Tomorrow will be too late
		It's now, my love won't wait
		It's now or never, my love won't wait
		No solo Miró, my love won't wait
	</pre>
